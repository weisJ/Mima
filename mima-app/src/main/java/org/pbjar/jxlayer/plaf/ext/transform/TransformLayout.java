/**
 * A specialized layout manager for {@link JXLayer} in combination with the {@link TransformUI}.
 *
 * <p>It extends {@link DefaultLayerLayout} and, as long as no enabled {@link TransformUI} is set to
 * {@link JXLayer}, will act exactly the same as its super class.
 *
 * <p>However, when the above conditions are all true, its behavior becomes different:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instead of setting the view's size to the layer's calculated inner area, it will set the
 * view's size to its preferred size.
 * <li>Instead of setting the view's bounds to the calculated inner area, it will center the view
 * in that inner area. This may result in some parts of the view formally obscured, or, some
 * parts of the inner area not covered by the view.
 * <li>The preferred size will first be computed by the super implementation. Then, before
 * returning, the calculated size will be transformed with the {@link AffineTransform}
 * returned by {@link TransformUI#getPreferredTransform(Dimension, JXLayer)};
 * <li>The minimum size will first be computed by the super implementation. Then, before
 * returning, the calculated size will be transformed with the {@link AffineTransform}
 * returned by {@link TransformUI#getPreferredTransform(Dimension, JXLayer)};
 * </ol>
