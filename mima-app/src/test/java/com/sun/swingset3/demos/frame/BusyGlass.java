/**
 * GlassPane component which can be set on toplevel
 * containers to makes those containers "busy" be disabling input.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre><code>
 *    // Install glasspane
 *    frame.setGlassPane(new BusyGlass());
 *
 *    // Make frame busy
 *    frame.getGlassPane().setVisible(true);

 * Caution: A well-written client should rarely need to make
 * a window "busy" because the app should be as responsive as possible;
 * long-winded operations should be off-loaded to non-GUI threads
