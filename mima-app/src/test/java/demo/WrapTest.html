<h2 align="center">Wrapping one JXLayer into another JXLayer</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        First, a JTextPane (this text) is wrapped by a JXLayer (layer-one)
        with a mouse drawing UI.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then, layer-one is wrapped by a JXLayer
        (layer-two) with a hide cursor UI.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then, layer-two is wrapped by a JXLayer
        (layer-three) with a magnifier glass UI.
    </li>
    <li>Layer-three is added to a JFrame.</li>
</ul>
<h2 align="center">A small explanation what you can do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mouse drawing is performed by pressing a mouse button and moving the mouse around.
    </li>
    <li>
        Via the options menu you can disable / enable the layer UIs separately.
    </li>
    <li>
        Also via the options menu, you have some control over the layer UIs:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mouse drawing UI:
                you can clear the drawing
                and you can set the color for the next lines that are drawn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hide cursor UI: you can change the timeout value
                (the time that the cursor will be visible after a mouse movement).
            </li>
            <li>
                Magnifier glass UI:
                you can change the magnification factor
                and you can change the radius of the glass.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>
