<h1 align="center">Exploring JXLayerUI 2</h1>
<h2>Sharing the same LayerUI between multiple JXLayers</h2>
<p>
    In this test we explore what happens if the same LayerUI
    instance is shared between multiple JXLayer instances. We use
    the same setup of wrapped JXLayer components (mouse drawing,
    hide cursor and magnifying glass) as in the previous test.
</p>
<p>
    But this time we create two sets of wrapped JXLayers. They share
    the same instances of the mouse drawing, hide cursor and
    magnifying glass LayerUIs.
</p>
<p>
    The LayerUIs are such designed that the state information that
    they need to maintain is kept in a separate StateObject that,
    upon stall time, is stored as a client property in the JXLayer.
    So, in this test setup, each LayerUI maintains two StateObjects,
    one for each set of wrapped JXLayers.

<h3>The menu</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The
        <b>General UI</b>
        menu contains the menu items to enable / disable the shared
        LayerUIs
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <b>Left</b>
        and
        <b>Right</b>
        menu contain the menu items to change the state maintained
        for the left and right component.
